# Fenced Code Block

The basic Markdown syntax allows you to create [code blocks]() by indenting lines by four spaces or one tab. If you find that inconvenient, try using fenced code blocks. Depending on your Markdown processor or editor, you’ll use three backticks (```) or three tildes (~~~) on the lines before and after the code block. The best part? You don’t have to indent any lines!


```
{

    "firstname": "Mohd",
    "lastname": "Rafeeq",
    "age": 25
}
```

Tip:  Need to display backticks inside a code block? See this section to learn how to escape them.
